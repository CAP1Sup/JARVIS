# JARVIS
This is a repository where I will be working on my own version of JARVIS, standing for Just Another Rendition of Vision's Intelligence System. It will serve to accept voice commands, and call APIs based on them to carry out the tasks it needs to do. It will then talk back to you. It's my redition of JARVIS, with my own flair added in.
